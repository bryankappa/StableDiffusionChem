# StableDiffusionChem

Stable diffusion algorithms have revolutionized the field of molecular structure prediction by enabling the generation of chemically feasible 2D/3D molecular structures from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. These algorithms prioritize stable conformations by considering factors such as bond and torsional angles, as well as intermolecular interactions.
